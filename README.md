# Minimal_NN
Minimal c++ implementation of a neural network.

This code was developed by me as a semestral project in course PV021 - Neural Networks on Masaryk University.
Criteria were: No matrix libraries; Exclusively CPU implementation; Must compile, train, evaluate and export results in under 30 minutes and get a test accuracy >= 88% on Fashion Mnist dataset.

There is no license on this repository, can serve as a demonstration of how to implement a simple Neural Network in c++.
